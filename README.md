# Interactive-Seismic-Data-Section-Plot
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Plotly library to create an interactive web-based application for plotting seismic data sections from SEG-Y files.

### Source Code and Data Credit
The source code for this practice coding is from https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/pylops/01_seismic_inversion.ipynb. Instead of matplotlib, I used plotly library to make the generated seismic data section plot interactive.

Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil) and the former Volve license partners, ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Norway AS and Bayerngas Norge AS, are credited for providing the VOLVE dataset under CC BY 4.0 license.
