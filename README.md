# Interactive-Seismic-Data-Section-Plot
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Plotly library to create an interactive web-based application for plotting seismic data sections from SEG-Y files.

## Note on the Uploaded Github Files
The uploaded python code file (`Seismic Data Section Plot.ipynb`) is too big to display on Github. You can download the file from this repository and open it on Jupyter notebook or VS Studio Code. An alternative HTML file (`Seismic Data Section Plot.html`) is included in this repository, which showcases the interactive plot without the need to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Credit and Source Code
Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil) and the former Volve license partners, ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Norway AS and Bayerngas Norge AS, are credited for providing the VOLVE dataset under CC BY 4.0 license.

The code for this practice coding was adapted from the code found on Equinor's GitHub page, linked here: https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/pylops/01_seismic_inversion.ipynb. I used the Plotly library to make the generated seismic data section plot interactive, instead of using Matplotlib.
